# Titanic_dataset-project.:
codesoft first project 
This project aims to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as class, gender, age, and fare. The dataset used for this analysis is the famous Titanic dataset.
Dataset
The dataset for this project can be found in the 'titanic.csv' file. It contains the following columns:

Passenger Class (Pclass)
Gender (Sex)
Age
Fare
Survived (Target variable: 0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)
Methodology
Data preprocessing: We cleaned the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Splitting the data: The dataset was divided into a training set and a testing set.
Model selection: We used a Decision Tree Classifier for prediction.
Model training: The model was trained on the training data.
Model evaluation: We assessed the model's performance using accuracy as the metric.
Results
The accuracy of our Titanic survival prediction model.

Dependencies
Python
pandas
